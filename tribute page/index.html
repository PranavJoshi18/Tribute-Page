        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>Cinemas are not only the best ways of entertainment but they also teach us and we learn a lot from them.
        Either it is a good habit or a bad one because they show everything and it is up to us as what we choose. 
        I can say that it has really affected us and its impact can be easily seen in our society as well as on us. 
        All of us love watching movies and really can’t imagine a life without cinemas.It will be not wrong if I say we have developed a lot and one of the best ways to analyze our development is cinema.
        You can watch a 90’s movie and then watch the latest release and the difference will be just in front of you.</p>
        <p>Movies play a very important role in building our society; there are many movies that reflect what’s going on in society: the caste system, dowry, killing of the girl child, etc. Many movies were made to teach society and really, they helped a lot to bring some change.
            When people see, feel, and understand, it automatically helps them to change. Today there is a drastic change in the ratios of the girls' literacy rate, the killing of a girl child, etc. Movies have played a major role in abolishing these taboos from society.</p>
        <p>Movies have also played a very important role in changing our mentality. Our youth is fastly adopting western culture, attire, we can say everything. Nowadays movies are the main source of knowing other cultures. Hollywood movies are so famous in India and we also want to be like them.
            So, I can say that our youth is fastly accepting another tradition and it is not a good thing. Everything should be in a limit; one should not forget his roots and traditions. Our youth should understand the importance of their own culture.
            It is good to learn new things but one should also think about his own culture. Our youth is orienting towards the west and movies have badly affected our culture. For example, if there is a tradition of opening shoes out of the home means one should understand the science behind it. Actually, our shoes carry lots of bacteria with them so it is a better option to open them outside.</p>
